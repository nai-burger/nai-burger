- 👋 Hi, I’m @nai-burger
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to code, if there's a book for dummies send it my way please!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what coding is (literally starting from scratch!)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that will help me gain understanding and exprience, and hopefully for someone to help a girl out
- 📫 How to reach me: feel free to email me at chaney.burger@gmail.com
